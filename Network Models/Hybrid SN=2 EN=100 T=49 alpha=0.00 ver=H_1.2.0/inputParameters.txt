 Program:        Hybrid Random Growth Network Model,
 Version:        H_1.2.0,
 Ouput Location: Hybrid: SN=2 EN=100 T=49 alpha=0.00 ver=H_1.2.0 

 Start with 2 nodes, add 2 nodes / time step for 49 time steps

 Creating a total of 100 nodes and 197 connections

 For alpha = 0.00, per time step, 0 connections are random and 2 are preferrential attachment
