 Summary of network generation input parameters


 Program:        Hybrid Random Growth Network Model,
 Version:        H_1.2.0,
 Ouput Location: Hybrid SN=5 EN=1000 T=199 alpha=0.00 ver=H_1.2.0 

 Start with 5 nodes, add 5 nodes / time step for 199 time steps

 Creating a total of 1000 nodes and 4985 connections

 For alpha = 0.00, per time step, 0 connections are random and 5 are preferrential attachment
