# Polis Economic Modeling

We implement and test an economic model based on a trusted network and a 
transitive-transaction process for exchanging coins between agents when 
executing a transaction between a Buyer and Seller.

## Getting Started

There are 2 main algorithms

* An algorithm for generating a network named "generateHybridNetwork"
* An algorithm for simulating the economic model named 
"model_commerce_V1_4" 

### Prerequisites

* Matlab is required
* Octave is an option, but the code is not converted (smallish job maybe)

### Installing and Running

** General

* Clone a branch 
* Launch Matlab and navigate to /economic-model
* Set your path to /economic-model and include all subfolders 
* Run a script from the commandline

** Network generation

** Economic Model generation


## Running the tests

* Run the script /economic-model/Objects/TestScripts/testSuite.m. If they pass, yea (they should)!

## Deployment

All code is designed to run on your local computer

## Built With

* Matlab R2019a
