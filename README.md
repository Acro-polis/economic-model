# Polis Economic Modeling

Our goal is to model a world consisting of agents connected on a trusted network, earning crypto UBI subject Demurrage and spending their currencies with each other via various economic transactions. Coins are transferred between agents using a transitive-transaction model. Much of our work and findings to date can be found [here](https://blog.polis.global/economic-model) 

## Getting Started

There are 2 main algorithms

* An algorithm for generating a random network named "generateHybridNetwork"

* An algorithm for simulating the economic model named 
"model_commerce_V1_4" 

### Prerequisites

* Matlab is required
* Octave is an option, but the code is not converted (smallish job maybe)

### Installing and Running

## Installation

* Clone a branch 
* Launch Matlab and navigate to the project root /economic-model
* Set your path to /economic-model and include all subfolders 

## Network generation


## Economic Model generation


## Running the tests

* Run the script /economic-model/Objects/TestScripts/testSuite.m. If they pass, yea (they should)!

## Deployment

All code is designed to run on your local computer

## Built With

* Matlab R2019a
